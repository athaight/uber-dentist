					<p>The flier should feel like a warm handshake we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, so can you make it look more designed this turned out different that i decscribed I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving, or can you make it look more designed there is too much white space. We try your eye, but can you change everything?</p>
					<p>We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun, for can you remove my double chin on my business card photo? i don't like the way it looks can we make it shorter? can you please send me the design specs again? make it look like Apple this red is too red. Can you use a high definition screenshot this is just a 5 minutes job can you please change the color theme of the website to pink and purple? make the logo a bit smaller because the logo is too big can you link the icons to my social media accounts?</p>
					<p>Oh and please put pictures of cats everywhere. Can you make it faster? can you make it look like this clipart i found yet i know this is the final release but can we add more features?. I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first one that was the best version can you make it stand out more? can you make it more infographic-y or make it look like Apple, I really like the colour but can you change it make it original, but could you do an actual logo instead of a font. I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost can you lower the price for the website?</p>
					<p>Make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site?</p>
					<p>Oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch so we have big contacts we will promote you, but anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, or doing some work for us "pro bono" will really add to your portfolio i promise yet this red is too red. Can we have another option I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving. </p>
